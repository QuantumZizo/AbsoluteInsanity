# Absolute Insanity
A Minecraft addon for Sanity: Descent Into Madness that allows various other mods' features to make the player (in)sane.

## Requirements
[Sanity: Descent Into Madness](https://modrinth.com/mod/sanity-descent-into-madness) 1.1.0 for Minecraft 1.20.1

## Description 
This mod allows other mods, usually with the survival aspect, to modify the player's sanity with their own mechanics.
For example, take the mod Cold Sweat, a Minecraft mod which adds a temperature system. 
My mod would lower the player's sanity if their temperature got too high,
imitating the real life fact that hallucinations and other mental tricks can be played on the mind when hyperthermic.
As you can see, the sanity changes added by this mod are based on what would happen in real life.
Take the mod Thirst Was Taken for another example. Being low on thirst would have a harsher effect on sanity compared to just being hungry.
Aside from just mental tricks played on the mind when the body is in a low condition,
sanity is also affected by encounters with horrifying beasts, such as the cave dweller (Not added yet),
or even encounters with Herobrine himself (Not added yet).
A whole list of these features can be found on this mod's [wiki](https://github.com/QuantumZizo/AbsoluteInsanity/wiki).

## Details
This mod is very configurable, see it's config file.
Please feel free to use this in your modpacks to forever enhance your survival or horror playing experience.
